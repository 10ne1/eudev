This git repo is a fork of git://anongit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd
with the aim of isolating udev from any particular flavor of system
initialization.  In this case, the isolation is from systemd.

This is a Gentoo sponsored project and testing is currently being done
with openrc.  However, we aim to be distro neutral and welcome contribution
from others using a varieity of system initializations.  We also aim
towards POSIX compliance.
